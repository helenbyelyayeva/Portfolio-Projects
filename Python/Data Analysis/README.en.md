# Stackoverflow Developer Survey Analysis

In this project, based on the 2022 Stackoverflow Developer Survey, I analyzed the results using the **Pandas** library.

## Task Overview

1. **Download the Survey Data:** Start by downloading the Stackoverflow survey results to your computer.

2. **Analyze the Data in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:** In a notebook environment,I provided answers to the following questions:

    - **How many respondents completed the survey?**
    - **How many respondents answered all the questions?**
    - **What are the measures of central tendency for respondents' work experience (WorkExp)?**
    - **How many respondents work remotely?**
    - **Among respondents in the 75th percentile for compensation and working remotely, which industries are the most prevalent?**
    - **What percentage of respondents program in Python?**
    - **How many respondents learned to program through online courses?**
    - **Among Python programmers, what is the average and median yearly compensation (ConvertedCompYearly) in each country?**
    - **What education levels do the top 5 earners have?**  
    - **What is the average yearly compensation (ConvertedCompYearly) grouped by education level (EdLevel)?**  
    - **In each age category, what percentage of respondents program in Python?**
