# Advertising Data Analysis and Visualization

In this project, I conducted data analysis and visualization using  **Pandas**, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** libraries in Python, with a specific focus on advertising data.

## Task Overview

1. **Download and Load the Data**: Start by downloading the advertising dataset and loading it into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Analyze the Data in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:** In a notebook environment,I provided analysis and visualization to the following questions:

    - **Visualization of Daily Advertising Expenses**: A line plot that shows the daily sum of advertising expenses in 2021.
    - **Visualization of Daily ROMI**: A line plot that displays the daily Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) in 2021.
    - **Visualization of Total Advertising Expenses by Campaign**: A bar chart that illustrates the total advertising expenses for each campaign.
    - **Visualization of ROMI by Campaign**: A bar chart that showcases the overall ROMI for each campaign.
    - **Visualization of Daily ROMI in 2021 by Campaign**:A box plot that displays the daily Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) in 2021 for each campaign.
    - **Histogram of ROMI Values**: A histogram that showes the distribution of ROMI values in the dataset.
    - **Correlation Heatmap:** Constructed a heatmap to visualize the correlation between all numerical indicators in the advertising dataset table. Identified the indicators with the highest and lowest correlation. 
    - **Visualized Scatter Plot with Linear Regression:** Utilized the "lmplot()" function to create a scatter plot with linear regression, plotting the relationship between "total_spend" and "total_value". This visualization aimed to illustrate the connection between these variables.
